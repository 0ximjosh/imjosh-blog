          I{"'"}m a software engineer based out of Austin TX, currently CTO at{" "}

            Manifold Labs
          </a>
          . We are building a compute market with an un-interruptible experience
          at a interruptible price, along with some other cool projects when we
          are inspired. Some of the projects I{"'"}ve worked on at manifold
          include <a href="https://github.com/manifold-inc/targon">Subnet 4</a>,{" "}
          <a href="https://targon.com/">Targon</a>,{" "}

        <h3>Past Work</h3>
        <p>
          From mid 2022 to early 2024 I was proudly the CTO at{" "}
          <a href="https://biblish.com">Biblish</a>, where we built the home of
          literature for the 21st century. During my time at Biblish we launched{" "}
          <a href="https://papertrail.biblish.com">Papertrail</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://submissions.biblish.com">Submissions</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023 I formed my own LLC called{" "}
          <a href="https://brunuslabs.com">Brunus Labs</a> to take on contract
          work. During my time at Brunus we built internal time tracking
          applications, lightweight POS systems, discord bots, Marketing sites
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Brunus Labs I was a Web and Application Developer at Cleveland
          Clinic. I created multiple web applications and moved all of our teams
          projects from TFVC to git (that wasn{"'"}t fun) amongst other things.
        </p>
        <h3>What I{"'"}m about</h3>
        <p>
          I love motivating people to build cool stuff, and encourage people to
          never stop learning. I like giving talks to classes at universities,
          and being involved in the tech community. If your interested in having
          me talk at your university or other event, shoot me an{" "}
          <a href="mailto:hey@imjosh.dev">email</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love helping out with open source projects where I can. You can
          find some of my contributions in{" "}
