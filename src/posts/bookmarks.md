I've been meaning to start keeping track of things I either want to read later,
or read and found super useful. Think of this as my reading list of articles
instead of books.

## Hardware

## Networking

- https://blog.cloudflare.com/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish-how-to-escape-the-linux-networking-stack/

## Other reading lists
