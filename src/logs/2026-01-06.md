Team stand-up was today, and pretty productive. We work remote but are all in
person for Tuesday planning. Its something like sprint planning, but not well
defined, nor do i think it needs to be with a team of engineers less than 10 in
total.

We also got some more updates shipped! Sybil got a few, along with a green light
for some new designs on Sybil and Targon, our designer is doing a wonderful job
with them.
