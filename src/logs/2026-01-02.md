Today was a bit slow, but I'm posting my first log. I want to start keeping
track of what I've done each day (regardless of what it is, assuming I'm
comfortable sharing online). The goal is to write a log for every day of the
year, ish, and hopefully this will help keep me responsible for learning
something new and being productive, and maybe even get better at my writing
skills (or lack thereof).

I have a few other goals, however I find the less I talk about my goals the more
likely it is to get them done. Monkey brains are weird. Instead I'll include the
hash of my goals below so at the end of the year I can reveal them and see how I
did.

To start the day off I got some more refactoring done on some of our core infra
at Manifold, specifically around how we handle logging in one of our
applications. Ill write up a full blog post the new approach as I'm very happy
with it and we will most likely adopt it into our other services. I fell like I
can actually get useful information out of my logs, and more importantly, they
are no longer a pain in the ass to write.

I also got a great workout in. Nearly passed out (again) as I haven't been
pushing myself nearly as hard as i should have been historically, so that felt
amazing. There are few things that feel better than a great workout. Today was
legs, focused on glutes and hamstrings. My ass is feeling sore, literally.

I'm not sure how verbose I want to make these. I kinda want to keep them
shorter, especially so I don't burn myself out, so Ill keep these to just the
main points I want to actually write to logs.

It is a bit Ironic I got the idea to do this as I was working on our internal
logging. Maybe reworking my external life logging will have some positive
outcomes as well.
